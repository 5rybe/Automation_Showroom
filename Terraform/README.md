* Deploying: Install a new bastion or AM on you infrastructure (AWS, Azure,GCP, etc.)
* Provisionning: Add resources to bastion (Target, Users, Groups, etc.)

Both category have different level of difficulty to understand them.

* Basic: base for learning, almost ready to run
* Advanced: need to understand base of Terraform and infrastructure where it's going to be deployed.
* Ultimate: need advanced knowledge and skills but real magic of automation is here.
